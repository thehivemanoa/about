### Calendar Page

The calendar page is where users can view all of the study sessions that they have joined. On left users can scroll through a list of condensed descriptions of each session. If a user wishes to see more details they may click the “show more” button. If the user wishes to leave a study session, then they may click the Leave button. On the right, there is a calendar which displays each of the study sessions in color-coded blocks.
