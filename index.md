# About Waggle

Waggle is a Meteor application that aims to provide ICS students of UH Manoa with a platform that allows them to easily organize in-person study groups for their classes, or help other students with coursework and projects.

## Key Features

### User Profile Page

The user profile page is where users can view the study sessions that they have previously joined or created. Under the profile picture is the user’s level. In general, as the user attends more study sessions and is reviewed favorably by other users, the level will go up. Eventually, they will qualify as a sensei or royal bee depending on the theme.

### Calendar Page

The calendar page is where users can go to browse new sessions. On the right users can scroll through a list of condensed descriptions of each session. If a user wishes to see more details they may click the “show more” button. If the user wishes to join or leave a study session, then they may click the Join or Leave button. On the left, there is a calendar which displays each of the study sessions in color-coded blocks.
